CVE-2022-21671,"@replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the `ConnectArgs`.

CVE-2020-26243,"Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation. In Nanopb before versions 0.4.4 and 0.3.9.7, decoding specifically formed message can leak memory if dynamic allocation is enabled and an oneof field contains a static submessage that contains a dynamic field, and the message being decoded contains the submessage multiple times. This is rare in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed. This is fixed in versions 0.3.9.7 and 0.4.4. The following workarounds are available: 1) Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof field. This will generate fields as separate instead of C union, and avoids triggering the problematic code. 2) Set the type of the submessage field inside oneof to `FT_POINTER`. This way the whole submessage will be dynamically allocated and the problematic code is not executed. 3) Use an arena allocator for nanopb, to make sure all memory can be released afterwards."

CVE-2020-15892,"An issue was discovered in apply.cgi on D-Link DAP-1520 devices before 1.10b04Beta02. Whenever a user performs a login action from the web interface, the request values are being forwarded to the ssi binary. On the login page, the web interface restricts the password input field to a fixed length of 15 characters. The problem is that validation is being done on the client side, hence it can be bypassed. When an attacker manages to intercept the login request (POST based) and tampers with the vulnerable parameter (log_pass), to a larger length, the request will be forwarded to the webserver. This results in a stack-based buffer overflow. A few other POST variables, (transferred as part of the login request) are also vulnerable: html_response_page and log_user."

In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4."
CVE-2020-14935,"Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the SNMP bulk get request response encoding function. The function parsing the received SNMP request does not verify the input message's requested variables against the capacity of the internal SNMP engine buffer. When a bulk get request response is assembled, a stack buffer dedicated for OIDs (with a limited capacity) is allocated in snmp_engine_get_bulk(). When snmp_engine_get_bulk() is populating the stack buffer, an overflow condition may occur due to lack of input length validation. This makes it possible to overwrite stack regions beyond the allocated buffer, including the return address from the function. As a result, the code execution path may be redirected to an address provided in the SNMP bulk get payload. If the target architecture uses common addressing space for program and data memory, it may also be possible to supply code in the SNMP request payload, and redirect the execution path to the remotely injected code, by modifying the function's return address."

The protocol being used is a property protocol by RMS Sentinel which provides the licensing infrastructurefor the network license server. RMS Sentinel license manager service exposes UDP port 5093 which provides sensitivesystem information that could be leveraged for further exploitation without any kind of authentication. Thisinformation includes detailed hardware and OS characteristics.After a decryption process, a textual protocol is found which contains a simple header with the requested command,application-identifier, and some arguments. The protocol is vulnerable to DoS through an arbitrary pointerderreference. This flaw allows an attacker to to pass a specially crafted package that, when processed by theservice, causes an arbitrary pointer from the stack to be dereferenced, causing an uncaught exception thatterminates the service. This can be further contructed in combination with RVDP#710 which exploits an informationdisclosure leak, or with RVDP#711 for an stack-overflow and potential code execution.Beyond denying simulations, Visual Components provides capabilities to interface with industrial machinery andautomate certain processes (e.g. testing, benchmarking, etc.) which depending on the DevOps setup might beintegrated into the industrial flow. Accordingly, a DoS in the simulation might have higher repercusions, dependingon the Industrial Control System (ICS) ICS infrastructure."

CVE-2020-29566,"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When they require assistance from the device model, x86 HVM guests must be temporarily de-scheduled. The device model will signal Xen when it has completed its operation, via an event channel, so that the relevant vCPU is rescheduled. If the device model were to signal Xen without having actually completed the operation, the de-schedule / re-schedule cycle would repeat. If, in addition, Xen is resignalled very quickly, the re-schedule may occur before the de-schedule was fully complete, triggering a shortcut. This potentially repeating process uses ordinary recursive function calls, and thus could result in a stack overflow. A malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest can cause Xen to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire host. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected.

CVE-2021-21261,"Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0."

CVE-2020-15211,"In TensorFlow Lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the `-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue is patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83), and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is erro-prone, we advise upgrading to the patched code."

CVE-2020-5217,"In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injection vulnerability is present in versions before 3.8.0, 5.1.0, and 6.2.0. If user-supplied input was passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a semicolon could be injected leading to directive injection. This could be used to e.g. override a script-src directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and the first one wins. The directives in secure_headers are sorted alphabetically so they pretty much all come before script-src. A previously undefined directive would receive a value even if SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT was supplied. The fixed versions will silently convert the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning when this happens. This will result in innocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally used. In future releases, we will raise application errors resulting in 500s. Depending on what major version you are using, the fixed versions are 6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0."
CVE-2020-11054,"In qutebrowser versions less than 1.11.1, reloading a page with certificate errors shows a green URL. After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow (colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However, when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green (colors.statusbar.url.success_https). While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl_strict to false, which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of security. This has been fixed in 1.11.1 and 1.12.0. All versions of qutebrowser are believed to be affected, though versions before v0.11.x couldn't be tested. Backported patches for older versions (greater than or equal to 1.4.0 and less than or equal to 1.10.2) are available, but no further releases are planned."

CVE-2020-5252,"The command-line ""safety"" package for Python has a potential security issue. There are two Python characteristics that allow malicious code to “poison-pill” command-line Safety package detection routines by disguising, or obfuscating, other malicious or non-secure packages. This vulnerability is considered to be of low severity because the attack makes use of an existing Python condition, not the Safety tool itself. This can happen if: You are running Safety in a Python environment that you don’t trust. You are running Safety from the same Python environment where you have your dependencies installed. Dependency packages are being installed arbitrarily or without proper verification. Users can mitigate this issue by doing any of the following: Perform a static analysis by installing Docker and running the Safety Docker image: $ docker run --rm -it pyupio/safety check -r requirements.txt Run Safety against a static dependencies list, such as the requirements.txt file, in a separate, clean Python environment.

CVE-2020-15208,"In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, when determining the common dimension size of two tensors, TFLite uses a `DCHECK` which is no-op outside of debug compilation modes. Since the function always returns the dimension of the first tensor, malicious attackers can craft cases where this is larger than that of the second tensor. In turn, this would result in reads/writes outside of bounds since the interpreter will wrongly assume that there is enough data in both tensors. The issue is patched in commit 8ee24e7949a203d234489f9da2c5bf45a7d5157d, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1."

The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by CachingHttpClient and if an attacker can control the response for a request being made by the CachingHttpClient, remote code execution is possible. This has been fixed in versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5."

CVE-2020-15199,"In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `splits` tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity to initialize a different data structure. Since `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to not be `nullptr`. If user passes a `splits` tensor that is empty or has exactly one element, we get a `SIGABRT` signal raised by the operating system. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1."
CVE-2019-16760,"Cargo prior to Rust 1.26.0 may download the wrong dependency if your package.toml file uses the `package` configuration key. Usage of the `package` key to rename dependencies in `Cargo.toml` is ignored in Rust 1.25.0 and prior. When Rust 1.25.0 and prior is used Cargo may download the wrong dependency, which could be squatted on crates.io to be a malicious package. This not only affects manifests that you write locally yourself, but also manifests published to crates.io. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0 is affected by this advisory because Cargo will ignore the `package` key in manifests. Rust 1.26.0 through Rust 1.30.0 are not affected and typically will emit an error because the `package` key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0 and after are not affected because Cargo understands the `package` key. Users of the affected versions are strongly encouraged to update their compiler to the latest available one. Preventing this issue from happening requires updating your compiler to be either Rust 1.26.0 or newer. There will be no point release for Rust versions prior to 1.26.0. Users of Rust 1.19.0 to Rust 1.25.0 can instead apply linked patches to mitigate the issue."

CVE-2020-15105,"Django Two-Factor Authentication before 1.12, stores the user's password in clear text in the user session (base64-encoded). The password is stored in the session when the user submits their username and password, and is removed once they complete authentication by entering a two-factor authentication code. This means that the password is stored in clear text in the session for an arbitrary amount of time, and potentially forever if the user begins the login process by entering their username and password and then leaves before entering their two-factor authentication code. The severity of this issue depends on which type of session storage you have configured: in the worst case, if you're using Django's default database session storage, then users' passwords are stored in clear text in your database. In the best case, if you're using Django's signed cookie session, then users' passwords are only stored in clear text within their browser's cookie store. In the common case of using Django's cache session store, the users' passwords are stored in clear text in whatever cache storage you have configured (typically Memcached or Redis). This has been fixed in 1.12. After upgrading, users should be sure to delete any clear text passwords that have been stored. For example, if you're using the database session backend, you'll likely want to delete any session record from the database and purge that data from any database backups or replicas. In addition, affected organizations who have suffered a database breach while using an affected version should inform their users that their clear text passwords have been compromised. All organizations should encourage users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords on any sites where they were used. As a workaround, wwitching Django's session storage to use signed cookies instead of the database or cache lessens the impact of this issue, but should not be done without a thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs of using signed cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way to fully mitigate the issue without upgrading."

CVE-2020-15118,"In Wagtail before versions 2.7.4 and 2.9.3, when a form page type is made available to Wagtail editors through the `wagtail.contrib.forms` app, and the page template is built using Django's standard form rendering helpers such as form.as_p, any HTML tags used within a form field's help text will be rendered unescaped in the page. Allowing HTML within help text is an intentional design decision by Django; however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made available to editor-level users. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.4 (for the LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.9.3 (for the current 2.9 branch). In these versions, help text will be escaped to prevent the inclusion of HTML tags. Site owners who wish to re-enable the use of HTML within help text (and are willing to accept the risk of this being exploited by editors) may set WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML = True in their configuration settings. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can secure their form page templates by rendering forms field-by-field as per Django's documentation, but omitting the |safe filter when outputting the help text."

Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled.

If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns ""=*;*&amp;"" or ""*%3b*&amp;"" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device&gt; show log httpd.log | match ""=*;*&amp;|=*%3b*&amp;"" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device&gt; show log httpd.log.0.gz | match ""=*;*&amp;|=*%3b*&amp;"" user@device&gt; show log httpd.log.1.gz | match ""=*;*&amp;|=*%3b*&amp;"" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked.
